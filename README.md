# Work-Day-Scheduler
This project was to create a scheduling tool for a workday. A user will be able to add an event for each hour of the workday and update their schedule as needed. 

I started by creating an array of hours of the work day and used that array to create a table of elements (in Bootstrap grid). I used to loop to create HTML elements using jQuery. It's a very large for loop, but I like the way it consistently created the rows. 

Next, I created a function containing if/else statments to change the background color of the hour column based on the current hour of the day.
